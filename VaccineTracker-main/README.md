# VaccineTracker

# Overview
In this project, we aim to make the process of booking a vaccination slot on the Cowin portal easier by notifying the user whenever a slot is available in their locality. Due to the enormous gap between demand and supply of vaccines in India, one often finds it very difficult to book an appointment for vaccination. For some people, it took several hours to book the appointment. So to save valuable time, we thought of making a simple program that will send an email to the user when vaccination is available in the locality. For this project, we used the following python libraries:\
•Tkinter\
•smtplib\
•BeautifulSoup\
•requests\
•Time
